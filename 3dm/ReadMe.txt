1. Open C:\Users\Jaswir Raghoe\Desktop\3dm\blender-2.77-windows64. 
   This folder has been provided with the necessary libraries to run the program. 
2. In this folder you can find blender.exe. 
3. Now go to ddm3Package, the other folder in the package. 
4. Open arap.blend with the blender.exe in the other folder. 
5. Now the blender program will open. 
6. In the toolbar go to window and select toggle system console.
7. Now for the next step we will run the script. 
8. Move your mouse to the toolbar above the bottom toolbar. 
9. Now scroll till you see run script button.
10.Select run script. 
11. You will probably get a file path error, because 
    "C:/Users/Jaswir Raghoe/Desktop/3dm/ddm3Package/ddm_prac3.py"
    isn't your file path most likely.If it is, we must definitely meet. 
    Change the filepath in the light grey window in blender and run the script again. 
12.Now the program ddm_prac3.py will run and deform the screwdriver.
13. The deformation is done on the part of the screwdriver that is covered by handle_0 (the cube).
14. The rotation of the deformation is set by the second handle: handle_0_dest.

PS: You can change these, keep in mind all object names matter as they are used in the code.
